# FramedCompactDrawers
This is an addon mod to [Storage Drawers](https://www.curseforge.com/Minecraft/mc-mods/storage-drawers) that adds frameable versions of the Compacting Drawer, Drawer Controller and Controller Slave. Much like the other framed drawers, the front, sides and trim (or top/bottom, sides and trim for the Controller Slave) can be retextured to any block using the framing table.
